# Quantopian Algorithms
These are cloned trading algorithms from my notebook on Quantopian which I can't link directly. Most of these algorithms are from tutorials or other community members who are more educated on financial programming than me. These are the ones I played with and looked at the most. 

Learning the whole Quantopian IDE, API, and financial concepts without any background in finance or economics taught me a lot. This project was more of a learning experience and less original work due to my lack of understanding in much of the background knowledge.
